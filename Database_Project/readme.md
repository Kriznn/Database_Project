For the user to start off this database program, the file, PA3_test.sql will need to be inputted along with the project program.

The python program will then read all of the keywords and lines in the PA3_test.sql file and will execute actions according to the keywords present. For example, when the python program reads the keyword, "create table", it will create a table in a separate text file. Then when it reads the "insert" keyword afterwards, additional content will be inserted into the table.
